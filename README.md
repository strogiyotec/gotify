# gotify
Go lang cli app that notifies you about new versions of your binaries.

## Motivation
I use a lot of cli apps , but because most of them are not available in ubuntu repositories I build them from source or download binary from github.
There is no way(at least I didn't find) to check of binary that I installed is outdated and frew one is available.

## Gotify
`GOtify` provides a cli to check if your local binaries are outdated
